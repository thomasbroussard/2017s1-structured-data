# TODO 29/05/2017
- extract an html page that represents an identity form from your java project
- describe it through an xml file (metadata / template)
- from that metadata file, generate an html file (the same file in fact).
- try to add or to remove one field from the template, and check that it has been propagated in the html generation.

# TODO 22/05/2017
- reorganize the code to comply to the "services" approach
- reuse the metadata from the database in order to create the xml file.
- try to reproduce what is made at this address : https://www.w3schools.com/xml/tryxslt.asp?xmlfile=cdcatalog&xsltfile=cdcatalog
